                        <p class="font-14">This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to the XpathEdge (“Interactive”) Website, located at www.XpathEdge.com, (the “Website”). It informs you about the types of personal information collected through the Website and how we use, share and protect that information.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Applicability Of This Privacy Notice</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">This Privacy Policy applies to the personal information we collect on this Website and not to any information that we collect through other methods or services, including Websites owned or operated by our affiliates, vendors or partners.</p>

                        <p class="font-14">The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose to you what information XpathEdge may collect, how XpathEdge may collect it, with whom XpathEdge may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you have regarding XpathEdge’s collection of information and XpathEdge’s use and disclosure to other parties of information XpathEdge may have collected from you.</p>

                        <p class="font-14">When this Privacy Policy uses the term “personally identifiable information” or “personal information,” XpathEdge means information that identifies a particular individual, such as your full name, street address, date of birth, and/or email address.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Security</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">The security of information is important to us, and we are committed to using reasonable measures to protect the personal information we may collect. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and us or the information stored on this Website is absolutely secure.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Acceptance / Consent</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">By using the Website, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Types Of Information That May Be Collected</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">The following are the types of information XpathEdge may collect:</p>


                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Information You Provide To XpathEdge</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">We may collect and store personal information that you choose to voluntarily provide to us when you contact us, such as when you contact us for business purposes or in relation to a job application. Personal information may include your name, email address, telephone number, and your resume. We use the information you provide to respond to your request or question or to process your application for employment. We may also use the information to communicate with you about other topics that we think may be of interest to you.</p>


                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Website Usage Information Collected By Automated Means</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">We are committed to making your online experience with our Website informative and relevant. To achieve this, we collect certain information by automated means when you visit this Website, such as your IP address, the type of internet browser you are using, operating system, referring URLs, information on actions taken on the Website, how many users visited our Website and dates and times of Website visits. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor this Website to our visitors. We collect this information by various means, as explained below.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Email Communications from XpathEdge</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">When you open emails from XpathEdge, XpathEdge may receive a confirmation notifying XpathEdge that you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. XpathEdge also may keep track of what emails XpathEdge sends you and what emails you may be receiving from XpathEdge’s subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>


                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">How Information May Be Collected</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">XpathEdge may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:</p>

                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Cookies</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">As with many Websites, the Website uses a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a collection of information that gets stored on the hard drive of your computer when browsing the Internet. These small bits of code automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let XpathEdge know how many people visit the Website and where visitors go on the Website. In addition, cookies can let XpathEdge know non-personally identifiable information, like how many times a user has been on certain pages. By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help XpathEdge determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Google Analytics</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">We may also use third-party web analytics services on this Website, such as Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses technologies such as cookies to help analyze how users use this Website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this Website (such as your IP address, the URL visited, the date and time the page was viewed) will be transmitted and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information to monitor your use of this Website, compiling reports on Website activity for Website operators and providing other services related to Website activity and internet usage. Google may transfer this information to third parties where required by law, or where such third parties process information on Google’s behalf. For more information about Google’s privacy policy in respect of Google Analytics, please refer to <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a> .</p>

                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">The Website may use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Websites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Website, such as the frequency with which XpathEdge users visit various parts of the Website. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to XpathEdge or to another party authorized by XpathEdge to collect information on XpathEdge behalf.</p>


                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">XpathEdge may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, XpathEdge also uses IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information, for example regarding the frequency with which XpathEdge guests visit various parts of the Website. XpathEdge may combine this information with personally identifiable information XpathEdge obtains from you directly on the Website.</p>

                        <p class="font-14">Click-stream data is information collected by XpathEdge computers when you request pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps XpathEdge analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.</p>


                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">How XpathEdge Uses The Information Collected</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">We may use the information we obtain about you both to further our relationship with you and for other purposes, including to:

We require these service providers by contract to appropriately safeguard the privacy and security of personal information they process on our behalf.</p>

                        <p class="font-14">We may disclose information about you as compelled or required by law, to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, to protect or defend our legal rights, or in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or violations for our Terms and conditions for using this Website or other applicable policies.</p>

                        <p class="font-14">This Website may provide links to other Websites for your convenience and information. These Websites may operate independently from us. Linked Websites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly encourage you to review to better understand their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing personal information. We are not responsible for the content of the linked Websites, any use of these Websites, or the privacy practices of these Websites.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold mb-4">Children’s Privacy</h3>

                        <p class="font-14">The Website is a general audience Website. XpathEdge does not knowingly collect any personal information on the Website from children under the age of thirteen.</p>
